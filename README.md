## “what is this”

This repository holds all the Homebrew formulas for [dex][].
Right now there’s just one formula—the formula for `dexd`, the daemon that serves dex-specific files from your filesystem.

## “how do i do the thing”

```
brew tap meyer/dex
brew install dexd
```

## “that is too many lines”

i feel u. Try this instead: `brew install meyer/dex/dexd`

## “i find this readme underwhelming”

same. take a look at the [Dex repository][dex].


that’s all :wave:
